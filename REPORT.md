## Optimization Techniques Applied

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - **Null Values Handling**: Dropped rows with critical missing values and filled gaps where possible.
  - **Consistency Checks**: Ensured uniform data formats and resolved discrepancies.

- **Data Partitioning**:
  - Partitioned datasets by year and month to enhance performance and manage large volumes of data more efficiently.

- **Rolling Averages**:
  - Applied rolling averages to smooth out temperature data, which facilitated clearer trend analysis and improved readability.

- **Query Optimization**:
  - Indexed columns frequently used in queries (e.g., date) to speed up retrieval times.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Handling Null Values**:
  - **Challenge**: Missing data points in key variables.
  - **Solution**: Implemented strategies for data imputation and validation to maintain analysis accuracy.

- **Floating-Point Precision**:
